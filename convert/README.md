The Python code in this folder converts the [HoG data files](../data) to Lean files and
stores them to the folder `settings['output_path']` in [`converter.py`](./converter.py).

The main program is [`converter.py`](./converter.py). It is probably better not to run it directly, as we provide
a `Makefile` that will do it for you.

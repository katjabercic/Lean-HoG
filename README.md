## House of Graphs

The [House of Graphs](http://hog.grinvin.org/) is a database of simple graphs, encoded in the
[`graph6`](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt) format, with a collection of precomputed invariants:

| Invariant                    | Type | Description  |
|------------------------------|------|--------------|
| Acyclic                      | `bool` | A graph is said to be acyclic if it contains no cycle.  |
| Bipartite                    | `bool` | A graph G is bipartite if it is possible to partition the set of vertices of G into two subsets A and B such that every edge of G joins a vertex of A to a vertex of B. |
| Claw-Free                    | `bool` | A graph is Claw-Free if it does not contain a K_{1,3} as an induced subgraph. |
| Connected                    | `bool` | A graph G is connected if every pair of vertices in G are joined by a path. |
| Eulerian                     | `bool` | A graph is Eulerian if it contains an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian circuit is a closed walk which visits each edge of the graph exactly once. |
| Hamiltonian                  | `bool` | A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle which contains every vertex of the graph. |
| Planar                       | `bool` | A graph is Planar if it can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges. |
| Regular                      | `bool` | A graph is said to be regular if all of the degrees of its vertices are equals. |
| Chromatic Index              | `int` | The (edge) chromatic index of a graph G is the minimum number of different colors required to color the edges of G such that two edges incident to the same vertex have different colors. |
| Chromatic Number             | `int` | The chromatic number of a graph G is the minimum number of different colors required to color the vertices of G such that two adjacent vertices have different colors. |
| Circumference                | `int` | The circumference of a graph is the order of the largest subgraph of the graph that is a cyclic graph. |
| Clique Number                | `int` | The clique number of a graph G is the maximum cardinality of a clique in G. |
| Diameter                     | `int` | The diameter D of a graph G=(V,E) is the maximum distance between two vertices of G, i.e. the "longest shortest path" in G. |
| Edge Connectivity            | `int` | The edge connectivity of a graph G is the smallest number of edges of G whose deletion will cause G to not be connected. |
| Genus                        | `int` | The genus of a graph is the minimal integer n such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with n handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus n). Thus, a planar graph has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing. |
| Girth                        | `int` | The girth of G is the length of the shortest cycle (if any) in G. |
| Longest Induced Cycle        | `int` | The order of the largest induced subgraph of the graph that is a cycle. |
| Longest Induced Path         | `int` | The number of edges of the longest induced path of the graph. |
| Matching Number              | `int` | The matching number of a graph G is the maximum cardinality of the maximal matchings of G. |
| Maximum Degree               | `int` | The maximum degree of a graph G=(V,E) is the maximum value amongst all the degrees of its vertices. |
| Minimum Degree               | `int` | The minimum degree of a graph G=(V,E) is the minimum value amongst all the degrees of its vertices. |
| Minimum Dominating Set       | `int` | The domination number of a graph G is the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices such that every vertices is either in the set or is a neighbor of a vertex in the set. |
| Number of Components         | `int` |  |
| Number of Edges              | `int` |  |
| Number of Triangles          | `int` |  |
| Number of Vertices           | `int` |  |
| Radius                       | `int` | Let G = (V,E) be a graph. The eccentricity of a vertex v in V is the maximum distance between v and any other vertex in V. The radius of G is the minimum eccentricity of its vertices. |
| Vertex Connectivity          | `int` | The vertex connectivity of a graph G is the smallest number of vertices of G whose deletion will cause G to be disconnected. |
| Average Degree               | `float` | The average degree of a graph G is the (arithmetic) mean of the degrees of its vertices. |
| Density                      | `float` | The density of a graph G = (V,E) is the number of edges divided by the largest possible number of edges of the graph (i.e. |V|*(|V|-1)/2). |
| various eigenvalues          | `float` |   |
| Algebraic Connectivity       | `float` | https://hog.grinvin.org/ShowInvariant.action?id=19 |
| Index                        | `float` | The index or spectral radius of a graph is the greatest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. |
| Laplacian Largest Eigenvalue | `float` | https://hog.grinvin.org/ShowInvariant.action?id=22 |
| Second Largest Eigenvalue    | `float` | The second largest eigenvalue of a graph is the second largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. |
| Smallest Eigenvalue          | `float` | The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. |

The following special values are used in the database:

* `infinity`
* `undefined` - the value is not well-defined, or the data are missing in the database
* `Computation time out`
